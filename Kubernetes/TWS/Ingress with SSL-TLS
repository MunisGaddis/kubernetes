Ingress with SSL/TLS in Kubernetes is essentially the configuration of an Ingress resource to securely handle HTTPS traffic to your services. Let me break it down step by step:

1. What is Ingress:- An Ingress is a Kubernetes object that manages external access to services in a cluster, typically HTTP/HTTPS.

It provides routing rules, e.g., example.com routes to Service A, api.example.com routes to Service B.
It sits on top of Ingress Controllers (like Nginx Ingress Controller, Traefik, or HAProxy), which actually implement the routing.

2. Why SSL/TLS?

SSL/TLS ensures that data between clients (like browsers) and your services is encrypted.
Without TLS, traffic is sent as plain HTTP, which is insecure.
With TLS, the URLs become https://example.com instead of http://example.com.

3. How Ingress with TLS works

TLS Certificate: You need a certificate (e.g., from Let’s Encrypt) and its private key.
Secret in Kubernetes: Store the certificate and key as a Secret of type kubernetes.io/tls.
Example:

Ingress with TLS: Reference the Secret in your Ingress:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - example.com
      secretName: my-tls-secret
  rules:
    - host: example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80


Ingress Controller terminates the TLS connection:

Client → HTTPS → Ingress Controller → HTTP → Service.
The Ingress Controller handles encryption/decryption.

4. Benefits
Secure traffic with HTTPS.
Centralized certificate management at the Ingress level.
Host/path-based routing with encryption.
Can integrate with Let’s Encrypt via cert-manager for automatic certificate issuance.

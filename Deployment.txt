A Kubernetes Deployment is a resource object in Kubernetes used to manage and automate the creation, update, and scaling of application Pods.

ðŸ”¹ What Does a Deployment Do?
Ensures the desired number of Pods are running and available.
Supports rolling updates to update the application with zero downtime.
Allows rollback to previous versions if something goes wrong.
Monitors the health of Pods and replaces them if they crash or become unresponsive.
We need to create deployment in order to scale pod. 

Now Lets create deployment 

apiVersion: Defines the API version to use for this object. In this case, apps/v1 is commonly used for Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, and other controllers under the apps group.
One Line command : kubectl create deployment nginx-deployment --image=nginx:latest -n nginx-ns --replicas=2
nano deployment.yml 

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  namespace: nginx-ns
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
***************************************************************************************
This checks for syntax or validation issues without actually creating the deployment.
Kubectl apply â€“f deployment.yml --dry-run=client 
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml 
kubectl get deployment -n nginx-ns
kubectl get pods -n nginx-ns
To continuously watch the status of pods in the nginx-ns namespace, use:
To refresh every 1 second:
watch -n 1 kubectl get pods -n nginx-ns

This command scales a Kubernetes deployment to a desired number of replicas (pods).
kubectl scale deployment/nginx-deployment -n nginx-ns --replicas=5 
kubectl get pods -n nginx-ns
kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml

Deployment do rolling updates but replica dosen't 
kubectl get pods -n nginx-ns -o wide (to get more information about pod) 
Roll out Command :- kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:nginx-1.27.5 -n nginx-ns 
kubectl get pods -n nginx-ns 
kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment -n nginx-ns

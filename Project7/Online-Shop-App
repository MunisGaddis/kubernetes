Recommended Apply Sequence:
kind-cluster.yaml
(Only if you're setting up a KinD cluster from scratch)

namespace.yml
(Ensure the namespace exists before applying resources that use it)

configmap.yml
(Configuration needs to exist before the deployment uses it)

service.yml
(Safe to apply early; can exist before pods)

deployment.yml
(Pods will use the configmap and be exposed by the service)

hpa.yml
(Horizontal Pod Autoscaler should target a running deployment)

ingress-nginx-values.yml
(Typically used with Helm to install nginx ingress controller)

ingress.yml
(Expose your service via ingress; should apply after ingress controller is available)

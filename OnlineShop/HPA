To set up Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for your online-shop-deployment, follow these steps.

✅ Step 1: Ensure Metrics Server is Installed
HPA needs resource usage data (CPU, memory), which comes from the Metrics Server.
Install it (if not already):
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
Check it's working:
kubectl get --raw "/apis/metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/nodes"

✅ Step 2: Update Deployment to Include Resource Requests
HPA only works if your containers specify resources.requests (and optionally resources.limits):
Update your deployment YAML like this:

containers:
  - name: online-shop-container
    image: monudocker334/online-shop-app:latest
    ports:
      - containerPort: 80
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "100m"
        memory: "128Mi"
      limits:
        cpu: "500m"
        memory: "256Mi"

Apply the updated deployment:
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

✅ Step 3: Create the HPA
Run this command:
kubectl autoscale deployment online-shop-deployment \
  --cpu-percent=50 \
  --min=2 \
  --max=10 \
  -n online-shop
Scales between 2 and 10 replicas based on 50% CPU usage.

✅ Step 4: View HPA Status
kubectl get hpa -n online-shop

In Kubernetes, PV (PersistentVolume) and PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) are key components of the storage architecture that abstract the 
way storage is provisioned and used by pods.

📦 What is a PersistentVolume (PV)?
A PV is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using StorageClasses.
It's a resource in the cluster, similar to a node.
It represents a real storage device like a GCE disk, EBS volume, NFS share, or local disk.

📝 What is a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)?
A PVC is a request for storage by a user.
It specifies size, access modes, and optionally a specific StorageClass.
Kubernetes matches PVCs to PVs that satisfy the claim.
